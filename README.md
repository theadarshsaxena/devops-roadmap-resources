# DevOps Roadmap & Resources
### [This repository is currently in development phase, contents beings updated regularly]
This repository will provide you all the resources, study materials and important links from where you can learn about DevOps from very basics to advanced level.

## Roadmap

## 1. Git & GitHub
### Cheatsheet
  1. [Atlassian cheatsheet](https://github.com/theadarshsaxena/devops-roadmap-resources/blob/master/cheatsheets/git%20cheatsheet%20-%20atlassian.pdf) - For git commands

### YouTube Videos
  1. [MIT Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok) - **Best for Git Concepts**
  2. [FreeCodeCamp.org YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)

### Text based Learning material
  1. [Atlassian Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) - **Recommended for Git**
  2. [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
  3. [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)

Here, you must remember one thing, above resources are just for learning Git and GitHub. As soon as you learn other tools, you also need to learn integration of git and github with those tools and technologies. E.g. different integration and automation of github repo with Jenkins or any other pipeline.

## 2. Python (programming language)
Note: You can start with any other programming language as well but my personal recommendation is Python. Also, you have to start learning python from the DevOps perspective, that is, more oriented towards automation, Operating System management, server management etc.
### Courses + Videos
  1. [Edureka YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGJJIrtnfpk) - Watch till 7:38:23, Covers all basic concepts
  1. [Coursera - Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course?specialization=google-it-automation) - If refering this course, then, don't watch Edureka YT
  2. [Coursera - Interacting with OS...](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-operating-system?specialization=google-it-automation) - MUST
  3. [Coursera - Configuration Management & Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/learn/configuration-management-cloud?specialization=google-it-automation) - Skip this right now, you'll realize in future when to study puppet etc.
  4. [Linkedin Learning - Python Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-design-patterns-14304845) - Optional
  5. [Linkedin Learning - Python automation and Testing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-automation-and-testing) - Skip this as well, we'll cover this again later from other sources.

Right now, I would suggest you get the basics of Django and Flask, as well as different Python Libraries like numpy, pandas etc. It will be useful in future (you'll thank me later).

After learning the basics, later when required, you'll know where and how to learn advance concepts of Python. There are huge number of libraries that you may require in future, just get an acquaintance with those and don't try to learn all those. You can refer to documentation of those and implement them when required in future (that's how it works).

## 3. Linux (Operating System)
First get the basics of VM, installation of Linux and basic commands from any short YouTube video. Then, start with the following book. After that, depending upon how far you want to go you can start learning.

### Books
  1. The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction (Must, for basics till mediocre)

### Videos
  1. [IIEC RISE - Complete full series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6k_w-5R2qw&list=PLAi9X1uG6jZ2b1mUmrUcc_aEoc8tfss8e)
